This will entail ensuring the dataset outputted from the EDA and cleaning stage is infact clean and also carrying out some feature engineering to further improve the dataset. At this stage the data will be slight into the training , validation and test datasets.\n",

This is due to the current Twitter restriction requiring account log in for each attempt to scrape thus, making this unachievable for the 2m+ rows of data.\n"
