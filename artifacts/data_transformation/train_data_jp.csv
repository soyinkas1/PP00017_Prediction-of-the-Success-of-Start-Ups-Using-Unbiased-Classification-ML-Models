Among these issues are age, other assets held, income requirements, taxes, specific funding goals, and personal preferences.  However, the most important consideration is defining the acceptable level of risk for each client.  They have found that this is both a financial and comfort level that varies broadly by client.  Through financial modeling and some proprietary questionnaires, they help the client understand their specific acceptable risk level, and then design a strategy that optimizes the potential rate of return without exceeding that risk limit.    Stated simply, all clients want to make as much money as they canâ€”without exceeding their own unique risk level.   In selecting assets, they start the decision process at what they call the â€œSEPâ€ level.  SEP stands for â€œSocial, Economic, and Politicalâ€ themes.
