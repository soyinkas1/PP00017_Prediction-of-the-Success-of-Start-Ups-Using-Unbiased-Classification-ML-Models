Among these issues are age, other assets held, income requirements, taxes, specific funding goals, and personal preferences.  However, the most important consideration is defining the acceptable level of risk for each client.  They have found that this is both a financial and comfort level that varies broadly by client.  Through financial modeling and some proprietary questionnaires, they help the client understand their specific acceptable risk level, and then design a strategy that optimizes the potential rate of return without exceeding that risk limit.    Stated simply, all clients want to make as much money as they canâ€”without exceeding their own unique risk level.   In selecting assets, they start the decision process at what they call the â€œSEPâ€ level.  SEP stands for â€œSocial, Economic, and Politicalâ€ themes.

There is an evolution happening today in animation. The costs of running a production house with talented artists located close to a major studio is not cost effective, so work is often being outsourced â€“ but even then there are brick and mortar costs involved in addition to a loss of control. Aniboom uses the power of the Cloud in animation production to lower costs, increase speed and raise transparency.   Aniboom is an online production studio that makes animation by reaching out to our database of over 9,500 creators who are located around the globe. Aniboom's massive workforce allows it to find multiple perfect creators for any job. Interested in double redundancy? Done. Triple? Aniboom can do that too. Even quadruple. Due to the amount of qualified creators we can draw from, and the level of quality talent within, Aniboom is more flexible and scalable than a traditional studio. The Aniboom Virtual Studio online production platform allows us to review work in near real-time. And, our more efficient cost structure allows production at better rates than traditional brick-and-mortar studios.  Founded in 2006 by television industry veterans Uri Shinar and Avraham Pirchi.
